Background
----------
* ./manage compress -f runs through your templates using COMPRESS_OFFLINE_CONTEXT to populate template variables that lie within @compress template tags. 
* when it finds a resource that needs to be included inline, it uses the path to the resource as a manifest key and uses the file contents as the 'value'. This is all stored in manifest.json
* it also takes other resources that are not inline and compreses them into hashed file names in the CACHE folder

issue in GCP
-------------

* depending on configuration, gloud will append querystring auth params to your resource as a link in the template at runtime
    * this happens at runtime - so the template tag compress might be looking for href='foo.bar?expiry=123213' as a hash - ( this looks like it gets appended when you use the static() call - but tbd )
    * And this will be different than what was calculated before hand when the contents was created and cached in the offline step
* solution was to use GS_QUERYSTRING_AUTH=False
* this is only available 1.11.1 and beyond for django-storages module
